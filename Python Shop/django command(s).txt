To execute in a new terminal in the folder:
	command to begin project - 'django-admin startproject pyshop .'
	here, '.' signifies that the project is to be begun in the very folder
	'django-admin' is a command-line utility
	'startproject' is the argument

	
To run our development webserver:
	command - 'python manage.py runserver'
	with 'python' interpreter
	we are running the program 'manage.py' 
	and passing the argument 'runserver'

To create a new application in this django project:
	command - 'python manage.py startapp products'
	NOTE: such an app is like a python package that can be used across django frameworks
	here, same as above, but the argument is 'startapp'
	and the name of the app is 'products'

To automatically create a table in the db.sqlite3 file (using the class in models.py):
	command - 'python manage.py makemigrations'
	NOTE: To run this and not get 'No changes detected', do these steps:
	#1) Go to main folder (pyshop here)> settings.py> INSTALLED_APPS variable (a list of strings)
	#2) There, add the app from the products app that we have created in the format:
		'application_name.package_name.ModuleName', which, here, is,
		'products.apps.ProductsConfig'
	A successful execution gets us the prompt:
	- Migrations for 'products':
  	products\migrations\0001_initial.py
    - Create model Product

To run pending migrations (run everytime you create a new model, or modify an existing one):
	command - 'python manage.py migrate'
	Django will look at our apps and run all pending migrations.
